# Volvo-RTI-Crankshaft-Canbus-Melbus
I'm not a programmer/coder and this is my first project, so if anyone can help with editing the codes so I could use less hardware, that would be awesome. In a 2005 Volvo V70 the RTI screen displays Crankshaft, can be navigated using the steering wheel buttons and plays sound to the original stereo. Raspberry Pi + 3b, Arduino Nano, ESP32, ESP8266
